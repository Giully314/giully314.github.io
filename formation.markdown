## PROJECTS
Working on [Gargantua](https://github.com/Giully314/Gargantua) a 2d game engine from scratch in C++23.  
Working on [loxcompiler](https://github.com/Giully314/loxcompiler) a compiler using LLVM for the Lox programming language.   
Working on [ElementsOfProgramming](https://github.com/Giully314/ElementsOfProgramming) a mathematical framework for programming.  
Working on [Murphy](https://github.com/Giully314/Murphy) a web browser from scratch, in C++23.  
[Endurance](https://github.com/Giully314/Endurance) a simple implementation of automatic differentiation reverse mode.  
[loxlol](https://github.com/Giully314/loxlol) an interpreter for the lox language.  
[Squad](https://github.com/Giully314/squad) a try on the SQUAD dataset (question answering) with the bidaf model.  
[Build a 6502 computer from scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH) run "Hello world" on 
a computer built from scratch using a 6502. I'm planning to write a kernel once i finish the base project.
